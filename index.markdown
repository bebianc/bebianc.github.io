## **Professional Summary**
I have been working as a **Senior SRE and Observability** at Softplan for over 3 years. For the past 2 years, I have taken on the role of **Technical Lead** for the team, overseeing the resolution of critical scenarios such as Windows, Docker, and Kubernetes cluster unavailability, system performance degradation, high network latency, and excessive resource consumption by servers and applications.

I have successfully implemented key infrastructure improvements, including the **redesign of server pool architecture** to optimize resource utilization and reliability. I also played a pivotal role in several migration initiatives, such as:

- **Migration of legacy applications from Docker to Kubernetes**, with a strong focus on security and performance, leveraging CI/CD pipelines.
- **Migration of sensitive data to secure storage solutions**, ensuring data integrity and compliance.
In addition, I have developed **comprehensive documentation** and conducted **training programs** on company technologies to upskill teams and ensure knowledge sharing across departments.

My approach combines proactive monitoring, robust incident management, and the continuous pursuit of innovative solutions to enhance system reliability and scalability.
